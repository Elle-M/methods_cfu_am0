# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

that seems to be pretty easy

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

not as confident, need to review

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

honestly, I need to reprocess that information.
